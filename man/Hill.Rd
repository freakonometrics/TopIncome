\title{Hill estimator of the tail index, with weights}
\usage{
Hill(data, weights = rep(1, length(data)))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{the vector of observations}

\item{weights}{the vector of weights (default is uniform weights)}
}
\value{
Hill estimator of \code{xi} (the tail index) and \code{alpha}, as well as \code{k} the number of observations

 Note that \code{weights} do not need to sum up to 1 (function will convert them via \code{weights/sum(weights)})
}
\description{
Hill estimator of the tail index, with weights
}
\examples{
set.seed(123)
x <- rpareto1(100, 1, 1.5)
w <- rgamma(100,10,10)
Hill(x,w)
}
